Problem: While the mental health benefits of journaling are well-documented,
many people struggle to maintain a consistent practice. They face "blank page" anxiety, don't
know what to write about, and find it difficult to reflect on past entries to identify meaningful
patterns in their thoughts, emotions, and behaviors. As a result, the journal becomes a log of
events rather than a tool for growth.
